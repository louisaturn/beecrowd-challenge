Solving problems on https://www.beecrowd.com but with a litte twist: for each problem, I pick a random programming language!

If you want to play with me, you can clone this repository and execute `python random_language.py`. This will generate a new file which name is the number of the beecrowd problem to be solved with the choosen language extension.
